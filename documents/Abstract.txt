Building a Self-Driving Car with Real-Time Object Detection and Collision Avoidance Capabilities

The field of artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing, with exciting developments such as the question-answering chatbot ChatGPT and self-driving cars from companies like Tesla, GM, and Ford. Enlightened by the similar concepts, this project aims to build an autonomous car on a smaller scale. 
Cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and infrared sensors were used to make a completely autonomous car that can follow a track, avoids obstacles, and reads traffic signs.
While driving, split second decisions may need to be made to avoid obstacles or stop at a stop sign making accuracy and timing very important. 
By utilizing the Cuda cores on the Nvidia Jetson Nano, image data was processed in real-time using Yolov7, a deep neural network object detection algorithm.
