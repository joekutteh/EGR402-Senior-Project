Draft 1:
Artificial intelligence is taking the world by storm. 
The latest developments in AI include a chat bot named ChatGPT, which can answer questions in seconds.
Autonomous or self-driving cars have made leaps in the recent years.
Automotive companions like Tesla, GM, and Ford are working on autonomous systems of their own.
These systems are not perfect, but they are making advances every day.
The goal of this project is to take these same concepts and build an autonomous car on a smaller scale.
Cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and infrared sensors were used to make a completely autonomous car that can follow a track, avoids obstacles, and reads traffic signs.
While driving, split second decisions may need to be made to avoid obstacles or stop at a stop sign making accuracy and timing very important when it comes to autonomous car systems. 
By utilizing the Cuda cores on the Nvidia Jetson Nano, image data was processed in real-time allowing the car to make quick decisions on its path.


Final draft:
The field of artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing, with exciting developments such as the question-answering chatbot ChatGPT and self-driving cars from companies like Tesla, GM, and Ford. Enlightened by the similar concepts, this project aims to build an autonomous car on a smaller scale. 
Cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and infrared sensors were used to make a completely autonomous car that can follow a track, avoids obstacles, and reads traffic signs.
While driving, split second decisions may need to be made to avoid obstacles or stop at a stop sign making accuracy and timing very important. 
By utilizing the Cuda cores on the Nvidia Jetson Nano, image data was processed in real-time using Yolov7, a deep neural network object detection algorithm.
