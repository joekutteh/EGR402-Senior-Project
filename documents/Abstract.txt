Artificial intelligence is taking the world by storm. 
From being able to ask a chat bot anything and have it reply in seconds, to controlling an autonomous car.
Self-driving cars have made leaps in the recent years.
These systems can take you to your destination without having to make a decision on the road.
This same concept can be shrunk down to the remote-controlled car level as the same components can be used. 
Taking advantage of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and infrared sensors we were able to make a completely autonomous car that follows a track and avoids obstacles.
Utilizing the Cuda cores on the Nvidia Jetson Nano, we were able to use YoloV5 to avoid obstacles using the camera.
Having the ability to use a powerful computing device like the Jetson Nano, the use of multiple different sensors all at once enabled for faster and better detection of stop lights and objects.
Utilizing all the different sensors and YoloV5 enabled the making of a fully autonomous remote-controlled sized car that follows a predetermined path.
