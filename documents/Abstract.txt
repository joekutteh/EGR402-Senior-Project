Artificial intelligence is taking the world by storm. From being able to ask a chat bot anything in the world and have it reply with detailed information in seconds to controlling an autonomous car. Self-driving has made leaps in the recent years with cars being able to take you to your destination without ever having to make a decision on the road. This same concept can be shrunk down not the remote-controlled car level as the same components can be used. Taking advantage of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and infrared sensors we were able to make a completely autonomous car that follows a track and avoids obstacles. Utilizing the Cuda cores on the Nvidia Jetson Nano, we were able to use YoloV5 to avoid obstacles using the camera. Having the ability to use a powerful computing device like the Jetson Nano, the use of multiple different sensors all at once enabled for faster and better detection of stop lights and objects in the way of the determined path. Utilizing all the different sensors and YoloV5 enabled the making of a fully autonomous remote-controlled car that follows a predetermined path.
