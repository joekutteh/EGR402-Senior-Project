General outline

imports
init all ports and pin numbers (ultrasonic, IR, and DC motor)
declare vars

will need functions for:
getting distance from ultrasonic sensors
starting object detection
dc motor speed
dc motor direction (straight, left, right, reverse)
line tracking with IR sensors and how to change speed/direction

this is a very basic loop, actual code will be much more complex all running in real time
while(true)

start tracking black line with IR sensors
if line changes move in that direction to keep tracking line

look for objects and traffic signs ahead
if an object is ahead get distance from ultrasonic sensors
if traffic is detected act accordingly

end while
